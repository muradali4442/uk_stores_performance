# uk_stores_performance
In this project, I have to predict the performance of stores in UK. The data is preprocessed to remove unwanted columns which has no significance on the models.
Also there were some mistakes in the datasets which I have removed. One hot encoding is applied to convert catagorical data to numerical data. MinMaxScaler is also
applied to scale the data between 0 and 1.

After preprocessing, various machine learning algorithms are used to chceck which one is better. Three algorithms are applied in this work, Decission Tree,
Logistic Regression and Neural Network.

The following libraries and packages are imported. 
numpy. 
pandas. 
sklearn. 
DecisionTreeClassifier. 
LogisticRegression. 
TensorFlow.
Keras
