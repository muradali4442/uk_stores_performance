# uk_stores_performance
In this project, the performance of stores in UK is predicted. The data is preprocessed to remove unwanted columns which has no significance on the models.
Also there were some mistakes in the datasets which are removed. One hot encoding is applied to convert catagorical data to numerical data. MinMaxScaler is also applied to scale the data between 0 and 1.

After the preprocessing of data, the following machine learning algorithms are applied to chceck which one is better.  
Decission Tree  
Logistic Regression  
Neural Network  

The following libraries and packages are imported. 
numpy.  
pandas.  
sklearn.  
DecisionTreeClassifier.  
LogisticRegression.  
TensorFlow.  
Keras.
